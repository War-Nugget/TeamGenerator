# TeamGenerator By Sahil Patel

## Description

Team generator is my 10th homework assignement given to me by Georgia Tech. It was quite the struggle to complete but thanks to our instrucor, I was able to finish it. This program promts the user to fill in information about the users team including manager, engineer, and intern. You provide information such as name, id, email, or Github username and once completed, the program will build a beautiful website displaying all given information with respective links to sites or to send emails.

## Installation

*Steps required to install the project*

Before running the program, install package-lock.json and package.json and make sure jest and inquirer are installed.
